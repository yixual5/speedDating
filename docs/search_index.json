Do men and women have similar preferences in a romantic relationship? What are some most important attributes that contribute to a successful matching? Those are the questions at the heart of our investigation of the speed dating dataset. Speed dating nowadays becomes a common medium for establish romantic relationships. Speed dating allows participant to meet a group of potential romantic partners in a short amount of time. Disregard of the actual effectiveness of building a meaningful relationship within several minutes of dating, studying speed dating can answer some essential question about gender differences and racial differences in the dating market, which might shed some light on more complicated social issues. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources", " Chapter 2 Data sources The dataset was created and collected by two professors in the Columbia Business School, Raymond Fisman and Sheena S. Iyengar. The dataset was used for their paper GENDER DIFFERENCES IN MATE SELECTION: EVIDENCE FROM A SPEED DATING EXPERIMENT. In this section, I will go over through the basic setting of this experiment and how they collected these data. The data was collected during 2002 - 2004 speed dating experiments which is designed by those two professor. The data consists of 21 different experiment each of them has different number of participants, which is corresponded to the Wave feature in the data. In every experiment, every one would have a four minute conversation in an enclosed room setting with all other participants had different sex. After the first dating, they decided whether or not to meet someone again. These subjects are students from Columbia University. These participants were selected by answering some emails and fliers. In addition, they need complete a pre event survey which consists of age, field of study, race, tuition, zip code, income, goal, interests etc. In addition to these field, they were asked to rate six traits with respect to their potential dating partner (j=1) - Attractive, Sincere, Intelligent, Fun, Ambitious and Shared Interests. In addition, they were asked to rate what their opposite sex would look for in a date (j=2). Then, they were aksed to rate themselves (j=3) and how other perceived them (j=5) based on these six traits. Also, they were asked to rate how their same sex fellow think (j=4). After each round (4 minute dating), they had a scorecard to fill to show their likeness and willingness of a future dating (Yes or No) and rate their dating subject based on the six traits. In the half way of each experiment, these participants are asked to fill another questionarie to rate the importance of six traits in a potential date and their opinion of themselves. After one day of meeting, these pariticpants were aksed to fill another survey which consists same questions as the pre survey and to rate six traits. Finally, After three or four week, they were asked again to rate six traits. So as a result, the dataset consist of fews survey which has format attr j_i. The corresponding j values are stated above. In addition, i = 1 means pre-survey time and i = 2 means day 1 survey time and i = 3 means three or four week survey time. During the event, their rating has no j_i follow attr: For example, sinc means how this person rate their partner in sincere after 4 mins meeting. In addition, attr_o means the rate that their partner give after meeting. One problem with these dataset is that for each person, there are multiple rows and most of their column are same. The difference correspond to different partner’s rating and their own rating to different partners. The more specific description of each variable can be found here. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In order to generate effective visualization of the dataset, we performed several transformation to the dataset. Since the survey done by wave 6 to 9 use a different scale that other groups, we will first filter out the dating data of wave 6 to 9. The speed dating dataset contains 195 variables. Many of the variables serve the same purpose, for instance, both ‘from’ and ‘zipcode’ record where the participant comes from. In our analysis, we remove redundant variables and variables that do not provide essential information for the questions that we want to investigate. As a result, we selected the following variables which we believe are gender, matching or not, race of partner (race_o), race of participant (race), field of study, income, goal, age, age of partner (age_o), importance of race (imprace), median_sat (mn_sat), partner’s decision (dec_o), career, and attributes ratings. We include attributes ratings from both pre and post dating surveys; specifically, they are participants’ ratings of the importance of attractiveness, sincerety, intelligence, fun, ambition, and shared interests in their partners (attr1_1,sinc1_1,intel1_1,fun1_1,amb1_1,shar1_1), and partner’s rating on those attributes (pf_o_att,pf_o_sin,pf_o_int,pf_o_fun,pf_o_amb,pf_o_sha). We also included participant’s rating of their partner after each round. The remaining variables are: ## [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;iid&quot; &quot;pid&quot; &quot;wave&quot; &quot;samerace&quot; &quot;gender&quot; &quot;match&quot; &quot;race_o&quot; &quot;field&quot; &quot;race&quot; &quot;income&quot; &quot;goal&quot; &quot;age&quot; &quot;dec_o&quot; &quot;imprace&quot; ## [16] &quot;mn_sat&quot; &quot;attr1_1&quot; &quot;sinc1_1&quot; &quot;intel1_1&quot; &quot;fun1_1&quot; &quot;amb1_1&quot; &quot;shar1_1&quot; &quot;pf_o_att&quot; &quot;pf_o_sin&quot; &quot;pf_o_int&quot; &quot;pf_o_fun&quot; &quot;pf_o_amb&quot; &quot;pf_o_sha&quot; &quot;dec&quot; &quot;attr&quot; ## [31] &quot;sinc&quot; &quot;intel&quot; &quot;fun&quot; &quot;amb&quot; &quot;shar&quot; The varaible names in the original dataset is not self explanatory. We decided to use more detailed variable names that will make later visualizations easier to understand. ## [1] &quot;id&quot; &quot;id_within_group&quot; &quot;partner_id&quot; &quot;wave&quot; &quot;samerace&quot; &quot;gender&quot; ## [7] &quot;match&quot; &quot;partner_race&quot; &quot;field_study&quot; &quot;race&quot; &quot;income&quot; &quot;goal&quot; ## [13] &quot;age&quot; &quot;partner_decision&quot; &quot;race_importance&quot; &quot;median_sat&quot; &quot;pre_rate_attractiveness&quot; &quot;pre_rate_sincerity&quot; ## [19] &quot;pre_rate_intelligence&quot; &quot;pre_rate_fun&quot; &quot;pre_rate_ambition&quot; &quot;pre_rate_share&quot; &quot;partner_rate_attractive&quot; &quot;partner_rate_sincerity&quot; ## [25] &quot;partner_rate_intelligence&quot; &quot;partner_rate_fun&quot; &quot;partner_rate_ambition&quot; &quot;partner_rate_share&quot; &quot;decision&quot; &quot;attractiveness&quot; ## [31] &quot;sincerity&quot; &quot;intelligence&quot; &quot;fun&quot; &quot;ambition&quot; &quot;shared_interest&quot; "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Value Pattern Analysis: Whole Dataset 4.2 Missing Value Pattern Analysis: Subset of Variables", " Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Missing Value Pattern Analysis: Whole Dataset In this section, we will visualize and analyze the missing values in the dataset. The dataset we use contains two part: one part are variables documented by the event, and the rest of the data came from survey results filled out voluntarily by the participants of the speed dating events. In order to analyze the missing value trend, we are first going to generate a histogram of the percentage of missing value of all variables, which hopefully will give us some insight for the investigation of the dataset. Due to a large amount of variables, we cannot plot all of them and we decide to see some of important variables in the pattern plot. In later section, we try to remove some unnecessary varaibles and some variables missing a lot of values. Below, we calculate the missing value percentage by dividing the number of the null values by the total number of entries in each column. We would plot the missing datta percentage with a histogram below: From the histogram above, we can observe that variables like id, iid, wave number, and matching results which are data documented by the event have no missing values. Variables like race, career, and zipcode, and gender also contain no missing values. However, variables involving the evaluation of partners during the event, for example, fun and sinc (sincerity) have missing value exceeding 50%. It will be interesting to look into the reason behind the high missing percentage of those variables. For instance, different waves of the participants were asked to fill out different evaluative questions, and hence variables related to evaluation contain a large portion of missing values. In addition, it is kind of hard to answer these questionnaires with a lot of subjective questions. 4.2 Missing Value Pattern Analysis: Subset of Variables Based on the questions we want to investigate, we select 15 variables among the 195 variables from the dataset. Below, we plot the missing value pattern for these 15 variables: From the plots above, we can observe that Variables such as field, gender, income, match, and decision after the meeting have no missing values. We can observe that in the dataset, variables age, a1_1(importance of attractiveness), goal, impr (importance of same race) are often missing together. We need to further investigate the high missing value percentage of met (if youm met your partner before), and the result might give us some interesting fact about the dataset. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results", " Chapter 5 Results First, we will present an overview of the speed dating dataset by displaying the distribution of race, age, field of studies, and income of the participants across different genders. From the histogram above, we can observe that majority of the participants are White, and we barely see any Native American and African American participants. Hence, this dataset is very unbalanced in terms of diverse demographic background of participants. In addition to the distribution of race among participants, we also investigate how important is race from participants’ perspectives. We generate the following histogram and density plot to demonstrate the importance of race. From the histograms and density diagrams above, we can observe that majority of male and female participants gave a low rating to the importance of race. Specifically, a larger proportion of men rated the importance of race as 1 than the female participants. Does lower rating in the importance of rating related to a higher rate of successful matching? Here, we calculated the success rate by dividing the number of positive responses (when matching=1) by the total number of matching results. Then, we generate a scatter plot to see if the importance of rate is related to the success rate of matching. We didn’t see a salient relationship between success rate and the importance of race in the scatterplot above. However, we see that participants with high success rate (above 0.7) are those who rate importance of race with a score of 3 or below. Participants who rated importance of race with 10 face a much smaller group of ideal dating partners and consequently have a much lower rate of success. From the boxplots above, we can observe that men’s rating of attractiveness has the highest median, while men’s rating on ambition has lowest mean among all. Among female participants, rating of sincerity has the highest median while rating for shared interests has the lowest median. We can conclude that, for men, the most desirable trait is physical attractiveness, while for female participants, the most important trait is sincerity. Despite gender differences in rating traits, we can also observe heterogeneity within each gender group. Other than male participants’ rating of shared interests, all other ratings disregard of gender have outliers, and the distribution of all ratings are skewed. Among all the ratings, ratings for attractiveness possess the greatest variability for both men and women. We also generated a radar chart to compare the female and male ratings of the six attributes. We can observe similar features as in the boxplots. Male participants focus more on physical attractiveness than their female counterparts, while female participants value ambition more than the male participants. Male and female participants have similar perspectives on intelligence, sincerity and shared interests. The mosaic plots below show the association between different traits and the decision after the speed dating. Attrativeness, fun, and shared interests are positive associated with decision. In other words, higher the scores for those three traits, the more likely the dating partner would decide yes after the date. Interestingly, high intelligence and ambition score seemed to have a negative association with decision. When intelligence score increases from 9 to 10, the proportion of positive responses drops.
